Git Conventions
===============

The development of AvatarMod relies on `git <https://git-scm.com/>`_, which also provides valuable information about the project's tasks and history. For example, commit messages are an important summary of changes made.

To allow maximum readability of the git repository, you should follow these conventions.

.. note::
   
   Disclaimer: While we encourage you to follow these conventions, we haven't followed these rules perfectly 100% of the time.
