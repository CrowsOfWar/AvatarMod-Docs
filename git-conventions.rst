Git Conventions
===============

The development of AvatarMod relies on `git <https://git-scm.com/>`_, which also provides valuable information about the project's tasks and history. For example, commit messages are an important summary of changes made.

To allow maximum readability of the git repository, you should follow these conventions.

.. note::
   
   Disclaimer: While we encourage you to follow these conventions, we haven't followed these rules perfectly 100% of the time.

Commit Messages
---------------

Commit messages provide a summary of a commit, and possibly reasoning behind the changes.

The first lines of commit messages should be worded imperatively. This means instead of "The dog gets exercise", you would write "Walk the dog". Messages should be clear enough so a reader can easily tell what is going on. The message should be one sentence with first letter being uppercase. Omit ending punctuation (.!?). Some good examples include:

- "Tweak turbulence values of 'furious' lightning"
- "Rename ostrich armor 'Platemail' to 'Plate'"
- "Mark BendingStyles#get(UUID) as nullable"

These messages make it easy to tell what's going on.
