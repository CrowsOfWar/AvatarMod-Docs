Classes overview
================

This page explains the most important classes and interfaces used in AvatarMod that are necessary for basic understanding of the code.

Data classes
------------

There needs to be a place to store information about players' bending, progress, and other information. It also must be compatible with mobs and other entities, which means data should be tied to a more vague `Bender` interface instead of a player entity. The interface `BendingData` (`com.crowsofwar.avatar.common.data.BendingData`) provides the framework for data.

The `com.crowsofwar.avatar.common.data.Bender` interface allows logic to not be attached to an `EntityPlayer`. Benders can represent mobs, players, or whatever else the implementer wishes. Instead of using an `EntityPlayer` object like most mods would, the logic should use a `Bender` object so it's compatible with multiple types of benders. This has the advantage of making it much easier to design code that's compatible with mobs or players.

Since an actual instance of `Entity` is often convenient due to the sheer amount of data in that class, `Bender` objects must provide an `EntityLivingBase` which represents the entity version of the Bender. A player bender would provide an instance of `EntityPlayer`, while a firebender would provide an instance of `EntityFirender`. To maintain offline support, `Bender#getEntity()` can return null if the Bender is not currently in the world.

To obtain an instance of a Bender for your entity, call the static method `Bender.create(entity)`. To obtain an instance of data, call `Bender.create(entity).getData()`, or, more conveniently, `Bender.getData(entity)`.

Bending controllers
-------------------

Bending controllers represent each style of bending; mainly all of the abilities but also miscellaneous information about them (such as name). All bending controllers are derived from the `BendingController` class. The `BendingManager` class also keeps instances and IDs for each bending controller.

Bending controllers are stored in `BendingData`. They are found via ID. Each ID can be retrieved through the appropriate static fields in `BendingManager`, or by calling `controller.getId()`.

Abilities
---------

The `BendingAbility` class is the base for each ability. Obviously, the most important abstract method is `execute(AbilityContext)`, where the code for the ability is executed. Instances of `BendingAbility` are kept in static fields of the BendingAbility class itself. Their `BendingController` objects also keep track of them.
