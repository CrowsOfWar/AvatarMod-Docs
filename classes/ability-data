Ability data
============

Any ability data is stored in the `AbilityData` class. Each AbilityData keeps track of a Bender's progress while learning a specific ability, for example:

- ability level
- experience to next level
- upgrades

There is one instance of AbilityData created per ability, per `BendingData <bending-data.html>`.

An instance of AbilityData can be retrieved by calling `BendingData#getAbilityData(BendingAbility)`.
